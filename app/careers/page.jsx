      <h3>Help Us Build Something Meaningful</h3>
      <p>
        We're a democratically run web development company with a mission right
        in our name: Learning, Language, and Multicultural Advancement. If
        you're passionate about building tools that help people learn, grow, and
        connect across cultures, we want to hear from you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of our current opportunities are service-based contracts rather
        than paid roles, as we're still working toward sustainable monetization.
        But whether you're a developer, designer, writer, educator, or
        organizer, your contribution could be the key to unlocking our next
        stage of growth.
      </p>

      <h3>Open Opportunities</h3>
      <p>
        We accept general applications from people with skills or interests in:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Frontend or backend web development</li>
        <li>UI/UX design</li>
        <li>Education and curriculum design</li>
        <li>Community outreach and marketing</li>
        <li>Project or product management</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Even if your background doesnâ€™t fall into one of those areas, we still
        encourage you to apply. We grow through collaboration and shared
        purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most important thing for our company is persistance, endurance, and
        staying connected with the team.
