      <h3>Help Us Build Something Meaningful</h3>
      <p>
        We're a democratically run web development company with a mission right
        in our name: Learning, Language, and Multicultural Advancement. If
        you're passionate about building tools that help people learn, grow, and
        connect across cultures, we want to hear from you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of our current opportunities are service-based contracts rather
        than paid roles, as we're still working toward sustainable monetization.
        But whether you're a developer, designer, writer, educator, or
        organizer, your contribution could be the key to unlocking our next
        stage of growth.
      </p>
